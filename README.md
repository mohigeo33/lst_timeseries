# Land surface temperature dynamics in a changing landscape: A time series analysis of Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine

## About the study
This study investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship with land use/land cover (LULC) changes in an urban setting. The main objectives were to analyse seasonal variability, LST trends, and the response of LST to different LULC types in identified hotspots, including the correlation between them. A mixed-methods approach was employed, utilising remote sensing techniques and Landsat imagery to collect data. The sample included 462 images of the study area taken from 2000 to 2021, which were analysed using the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The findings revealed significant seasonal variability in LST and a visual connection between LST and LULC changes in specific hotspots. No long-term trends in LST were observed, despite fluctuations. A strong positive correlation between built-up areas and LST was identified, while negative correlations were found between LST and water bodies and vegetation. These results support the notion that urbanisation and LULC changes are closely related to LST variations, emphasising the importance of considering local context and specific LULC changes when examining LST dynamics. The findings can inform urban planning and management strategies, such as incorporating green and blue infrastructure to moderate LST values and improve the urban environment. This study provides valuable insights into LST dynamics and the relationship between LST and LULC changes, with potential implications for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers working towards creating more sustainable and resilient urban environments.
